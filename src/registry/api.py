"""``/registry`` router — plant registration and lookup (CRUD).

Owners see and change only their own plants; a superuser sees every plant and
can register one on someone else's behalf. A paired edge device (``CurrentDevice``)
can read the plant it photographs from ``/registry/devices/me/plant``.
Another owner's plant answers 404, not 403, so ids cannot be probed for
existence.

``DELETE`` archives rather than deletes: every other context keys its history on
``plant.id``. Mounted by ``main_web``.
