"""Plant Registry (context 1).

Identity & physical anchoring: the persistent record of which physical plant is
which — who owns it, what species it is, and which device photographs it.
Owns the ``registry`` Postgres schema.

``plant.id`` is the identifier every other context keys its rows on, so plants
are archived rather than deleted.

Public surface:

- :data:`router` — the ``/registry`` endpoints (plant CRUD + device lookup),
  mounted by ``main_web``.
- :func:`list_plant_ids`, :func:`get_plant`, :func:`get_plants`,
  :func:`get_plant_by_device`, :func:`is_plant_owned_by` — in-process
  interface for the other contexts; plants come back as :class:`PlantRead`.
