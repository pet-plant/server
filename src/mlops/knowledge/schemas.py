"""The output contract for probe generation — and the validation of it.

Owner: TODO

These models are **the schema handed to the LLM** (as a JSON schema, via
``with_structured_output``) *and* the gate every generated set must pass before
``knowledge`` is allowed to see it. Both roles matter: the first makes
well-formed output likely, the second makes it certain.

Deliberately Pydantic and nothing else — ``mlops`` must not import a bounded
context, so these are plain models that mirror the *shape* ``knowledge`` stores
without depending on its ORM. The calling context maps them onto its own rows.

Three layers of checking, weakest to strongest:

1. **JSON schema** — the model is constrained to the field names and types.
2. **Field / model validators here** — the domain rules the JSON schema cannot
   express: slug format, slug ↔ ``care_need`` agreement, unique slugs, the
   ``expect_typical_hours <= expect_max_hours`` ordering.
3. :func:`GeneratedProbeSet.validate_against_document` — grounding. Every
   ``evidence_quote`` must actually occur in the research document. This is the
   anti-hallucination check, and it needs the source text, so it cannot live in
   a validator.

Anything the model gets wrong here comes back as a ``ValidationError`` that
:mod:`mlops.knowledge.runtime` feeds to it as a repair instruction.
