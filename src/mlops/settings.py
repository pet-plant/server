"""Which Langfuse project a component talks to, and with which credentials.

Langfuse is split by project — one per LLM-using component — so there is a key
pair per component rather than one for the whole server. Secret values live in
``core.config.Settings`` (declared in ``.env.example``); this module only names
the components and resolves their credentials.

This is the *only* thing every component package shares. Everything else —
prompt handling, model calls, tracing, experiments, scorers — lives inside each
``mlops/<component>/`` package and is that component owner's call.
