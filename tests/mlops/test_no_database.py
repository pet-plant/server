"""An experiment must run with no database — no Docker, no ``DATABASE_URL``.

Prompts, datasets, runs and scores all live in Langfuse, so a prompt experiment
has nothing to ask Postgres. Keeping it that way is what lets anyone iterate on
a prompt from a laptop with only two API keys.

The rule is easy to break by accident: one convenience import of a bounded
context, or of ``core.db`` (which builds an engine at import time), and the
experiment CLI starts needing infrastructure it never uses. This test fails at
the import, before anyone discovers it by having Docker stopped.
